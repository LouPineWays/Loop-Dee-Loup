# LDL consumer-repository contract

This document defines the ownership boundary between Loop-Dee-Loup-managed
machinery and consumer-repository-owned material, and describes the bootstrap
mechanism (`tools/ldl-init`) that installs the former into an arbitrary
existing repository. It is itself one of the files that mechanism installs,
so an installed copy is available in the consumer repository without
depending on this repository being reachable at runtime.

See `docs/operating-model.md`, `docs/bounded-review-cycle.md`, and
`docs/decision-forms.md` for how the Loop itself works once installed.

## Two ownership domains

### LDL-managed (installed by `tools/ldl-init`, update-eligible)

Reusable engine/runtime material distributed from this repository:

- `.claude/skills/context-clearing/`, `local-worker/`, `model-check/`,
  `persona-maker/`, `retro/`, `script-maker/`, `sift/`, `skill-maker/`,
  `spend/` — the operational skills the Loop dispatches;
- `.claude/personas/audit-verdict-extractor.md` — the reusable Stage 2
  verdict-extraction persona;
- `tools/local-worker/` — the local-LLM delegation adapter;
- `tools/review-watch/` — the early-exit-on-match review-polling script;
- `docs/operating-model.md`, `docs/bounded-review-cycle.md`,
  `docs/decision-forms.md`, `docs/consumer-contract.md` — the operating
  model documentation those skills and the bounded review cycle depend on;
- `AGENTS.md` — installed only as described under "The AGENTS.md special
  case" below, since a consumer repository may already have its own.

Nothing else in this repository is installed. In particular, `tools/burn-order/`,
`docs/burn-order.md`, `docs/burn-order.json`, `docs/experiment-brief.md`,
`tools/check-control-plane-paths.mjs`, this repository's own `README.md`, and
its GitHub issue/PR history are Loop-Dee-Loup's own development state, not
reusable machinery, and are never installed into a consumer repository.

### Consumer-owned (never overwritten)

Everything else in the consumer repository: project source, project issues
and PRs, project-specific instructions and configuration, project-specific
skills or personas under other names, CI, build/test/verification commands,
and any pre-existing `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`. `tools/ldl-init` never
touches a path outside the LDL-managed list above, and never overwrites a
destination path that already exists and was not itself installed by a
prior `tools/ldl-init` run (see "Safety and idempotency" below).

## How to bootstrap

From a local clone of Loop-Dee-Loup, run:

```bash
node <path-to-loop-dee-loup-clone>/tools/ldl-init/index.mjs --dest <path-to-your-project>
```

`--dest` must already exist; it does not need to be empty. There is
currently no package registry, hosted service, or daemon — a local clone is
the documented source. See `tools/ldl-init/index.mjs`'s header comment for
full usage.

## The AGENTS.md special case

Loop-Dee-Loup's own `AGENTS.md` contains a few sections specific to
Loop-Dee-Loup's own development (its own Burn Order, its own prototype
trial). Those sections are wrapped in `<!-- ldl:source-only:start -->` /
`<!-- ldl:source-only:end -->` markers and are stripped before installation,
so what a consumer repository receives is the generic operating contract —
vertical-slice rule, decomposition boundary, decision-form rule, session
execution, bounded review cycle, and the operational-skills index — without
Loop-Dee-Loup's own instance-specific state.

- If the consumer repository has no `AGENTS.md` yet, the derived template is
  installed at the repository root as `AGENTS.md`.
- If the consumer repository already has an `AGENTS.md` that a prior
  `tools/ldl-init` run did not itself install, that file is left completely
  untouched, and the derived template is written instead to
  `.ldl/AGENTS.template.md` for the project to review and merge in by hand.

This is the smallest explicit configuration surface consistent with the
non-goal against rewriting a project's own `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` merely
to fit LDL.

## Provenance manifest

Every run writes `.ldl/manifest.json` in the consumer repository:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "ldlSourceRevision": "<git commit sha of the Loop-Dee-Loup clone used, or \"unknown\">",
  "installedAt": "<ISO-8601 timestamp of this run>",
  "files": [{ "dest": "<repo-relative path>", "sha256": "<hex digest>" }],
  "skipped": [{ "dest": "<repo-relative path>", "reason": "<why it was left alone>" }]
}
```

`files` is the durable, machine-readable record of exactly which paths in
the consumer repository are LDL-managed — a fresh coding-agent session can
read it without any conversation history to determine both the installed
LDL revision and the installed-file manifest required by the bootstrap
acceptance criteria. `skipped` records any destination path that already
existed and was not itself LDL-managed, so a human can see what the
bootstrap deliberately left alone.

## Safety and idempotency

- A fresh install only ever creates the LDL-managed paths listed above; it
  never reads or writes any other path in the consumer repository.
- If a destination path for an LDL-managed item already exists and is not
  listed in an existing `.ldl/manifest.json`, that one item is left
  untouched and recorded under `skipped` instead of being overwritten. This
  is what keeps the bootstrap safe to run against a non-empty, pre-existing
  project repository.
- Re-running the bootstrap against an already-initialized repository at the
  same Loop-Dee-Loup source revision reinstalls the same managed paths with
  identical content — a predictable no-op, not a duplicate or a corrupting
  write. `.ldl/manifest.json` is regenerated each run with a fresh
  `installedAt` timestamp but the same `files` set.

## Explicitly out of scope for this mechanism

- Detecting and safely resolving a local edit to an already-installed
  LDL-managed file (conflict-safe update) — the next slice.
- Updating an already-initialized repository to a newer Loop-Dee-Loup
  revision — the next slice.
- End-to-end dogfooding inside a real named consumer project, and
  public-facing quickstart documentation aimed at strangers — later slices.
